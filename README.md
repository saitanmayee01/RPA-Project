# RPA-Project
This project is aimed at automating the change of address of a given individual who opts to change their address in a certain identification card. Present day, in our country, there are many modes of identification to recognise an individual.These include aadhar card,voter id,ration card,driving license,passport etc. Since citizens are bound to change their place of residence due to several factors, their address needs to be updated in all their IDs. Hence,our team would like to make these changes of address easy by automating this process using RPA. It involves the use of Google form .This solution is not only applicable to the IDs, it can also be used by private sectors to edit their customer details such as by insurance companies,banks, etc. The final project will be able to accept the new address from a user through a form and update the corresponding field in the database. This eliminates the need for the applicants to be physically present in an office. RPA can be rightfully used in this situation since it can make the entire process highly secured and error free.
